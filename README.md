# Real-Estate-Project-for-Centro

**Background**
Real estate is the largest asset class in the world and plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy. Most
real estate firms have made decisions in the past based on intuition, experience, and historical data.
Today, with the availability of modern tools and the huge amount of high-quality data that has never
been collected before at a reasonable cost, it is possible for such firms to better understand how
properties are priced and make informed decisions accordingly.
Centro is a data-driven asset management company based in Miami, Florida, which focuses on the
acquisition and management of apartment communities and shopping centers throughout the
Southeast United States and Texas. It has so far raised and deployed $150M in 4 years and is looking
for potential avenues to expand the business. Given the nascent stages of data-driven quantitative real
estate investment, the company wants to stay ahead of the curve by understanding the key variables
that are, if not directly affecting rent and sale prices, good indicators of them. The ultimate goal is to
create an automated evaluation model that will not only help the company make more lucrative
decisions but also speed up the decision-making process.

**About the Problem**
The client wants to identify key indicators of rent and sale price by analyzing two datasets of over
20,000 rental properties in Texas, Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina which include hundreds of
fields such as property location, construction material, unit size, rent per square foot, and last sale
price. They would also like to stitch this data with external data from publicly available data sources
to better capture the supply and demand of the market.
